# Debug

Gandiva implements **RISC-V External Debug**: a JTAG Transport Module (DTM) plus
a Debug Module (DM) that let an external debugger halt the core and inspect or
modify its state. Hardware triggers add self-hosted breakpoints and watchpoints.

## Debug Module

- **Halt / resume** — request a halt at an instruction boundary; the core enters
  debug mode, saves the PC to `dpc`, sets `dcsr.cause`, and parks. `resume`
  restores `dpc` and continues.
- **Single-step** — execute one instruction and re-enter debug.
- **Register & memory access** — read and write any GPR (and CSRs) through the
  abstract command interface while halted, plus system-bus memory access.
- **`ebreak`** — with the relevant `dcsr` bit set, `ebreak` enters debug mode
  instead of trapping.

The DTM/DM presents a standard JTAG interface, so OpenOCD + GDB drive it in the
usual way. `build.sh debug` runs a self-check that halts the core, reads a
computed GPR, writes a new value, resumes, single-steps, and confirms the
program continues with the debug-written value.

## Hardware triggers

Gandiva provides `mcontrol6` triggers (`rtl/gandiva_trigger.sv`):

- **Execute (PC-match) breakpoint** — fire when the PC matches `tdata2`.
- **Load/store (address-match) watchpoint** — fire when a data access matches.

A trigger raises a breakpoint exception (cause 3, `mtval` = the matched PC or
address) or enters debug mode. Triggers are programmed through `tselect` /
`tdata1` / `tdata2` and enumerated via `tinfo`. `build.sh trigger` covers both
trigger kinds with near-miss negative controls.
